# Phase 1 Project

This website allows a user to keep a collection of their favorite TV shows. Viewers of the users collection are able to "like" TV shows in the collection. 

This website uses a local JSON file with data as well as the Single Show Search TV Maze Public API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-single-search) to retrieve data via the form at the top of the webpage.
